[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) is a set of 25 small programming puzzles. It is very fun
and can be done at any time of the year, not only during December when the new problems unlock.

This repo holds my solutions for Advent of Code (except 2017 which I did without saving the code anywhere).
